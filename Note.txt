-> Uses matcher classes for making assertion

Adv.
----
-> Human readable and plain in english
-> Code is neat and intuitive 
-> Provides thin methods like "is" and "not", also called as decorators for more readability.

Hamcrest vs TestNG
-----------------
-> Readability
-> Description error message
-> Type Safety

Collection matchers(List, Array, Map.. etc)
-------------------------------------------
hasItem() -> check single element in a collection
not(hasItem()) -> check single element is NOT in a collection
hasItems() -> Check all elements in a collection
contains()-> check all elements are in a collection and are in a strict order
containsInAnyOrder()-> Check all elements are in a collection and in any order
empty() -> check if collection is empty
not(emptyArray())-> check if the array is not empty
hasSize() -> check size of collection
everyItem(startsWith()) -> Check every item in a collection starts with specific string

hasKey()  -> Map -> Check if Map has specified key(value not checked)
hasValue() -> Map -> check if map has atleast one specified mapping value
hasEntry() -> Map -> Check if Map has the specified key value pair
equalTo(Collections.EMPTY_MAP) -> 	Maps[Check if empty]
allOf() -> Matches if all matchers matches
anyOf() -> Matches if any of matchers matches
